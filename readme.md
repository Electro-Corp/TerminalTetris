# TerminalTetris
Yet another terminal tetris game. <br>
For fun. Trying to be as simple and lightweight as possible.

## Controls:
A - Move left <br>
D - Move right <br>
S - Move down <br>
W - Rotate <br>
Space/Enter - Drop down <br>
P - Pause <br>

## Building
Doesn't use CMake, for portablity. Not all systems have cmake, but all will have bash. Hopefully.

```
sh compile.sh
./build/tetris
```
